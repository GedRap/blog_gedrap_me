For the last few months (about 8), I am working exclusively remotely. Sometimes from home, sometimes from university [1]. And like all of us, had those frustrating days when I see that’s evening already, haven’t done anything significant yet and I know I will have to compensate that tomorrow. Kills the mood.

Fortunately, I found a “cure” which gets me in a productive mindset from the very morning.

The first thing I do when I wake in the morning is I write some code. Maybe a quick bug fix, maybe add a little feature to my side project. Just some code, a minute after waking up.

So far, it worked amazingly well.

[1] We have something like open plan office building with 24/7 access during term time, totally free. Love University of Manchester.
