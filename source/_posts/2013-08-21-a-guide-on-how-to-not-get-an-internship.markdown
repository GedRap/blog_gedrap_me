I am writing this based mainly on my experience (which I am NOT proud of) and a little on what the people I know have told me. An internship is a bloody amazing thing. You are 20, and you go to Goldman Sachs to write some code. Or Morgan Stanley. Or ARM. You name it. You might feel like a king of the world for a while. You can’t wish for a better career’s start.

On the other hand, you might be listening to your friends and coursemates telling you how amazing it is and hate yourself (this is what I do) while thinking about getting the graduate job and competing with 40-100 people for one place. You don’t want to be in this position.

So here we go, the tips on how to make sure you will not get an internship[0] straight from the pro.

“Just give me a month or two, I will add something kick ass to my CV and will nail it”. No, you won’t, most of the time. If you were doing nothing for the last year or two, a month for a side project probably won’t change much. And if you were doing awesome stuff in the last couple of years, you are awesome enough. During the interviews I had, no one asked me a lot about my previous experience (a year of Web Dev at local start up at that time).

“Deadline is in 2 weeks, it’s enough time”. No, it’s not. The application is still open, but the chances are they have all the vacations filled up. Especially, if it is a mega corp. Most of the people I know who landed a good internship/placement, applied in September/October.

Get yourself some interview experience. The more you have done, the easier, less stresful they are. The first job interview in my life was at Morgan Stanley. I was too stressful to think when I didn’t know an answer straight away, or when I knew I tried to impress (too much) and talked lots of unrelated crap. That’s something you can eliminate only with experience. Googling for interview questions will not replace it.

“I don’t need the internship, I just… just… Want to graduate soon! Yeah. I want to graduate.” While sometimes there are genuine reasons why not taking it is better, more often it’s just an excuse because you would be stepping out of your comfort zone. It’s like 2 dudes at the party talking “Hey look that girl is so hot!” “Yeah, go and say hi” “Well… She’s not that hot actually”. Kind of.

That’s something I wish someone told me a year ago. Hopefully, you will not end up doing the same mistakes I did :)
