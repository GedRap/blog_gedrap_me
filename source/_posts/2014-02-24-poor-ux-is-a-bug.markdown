When I switched to being a full stack developer after working on the backend exclusively for a while, I sucked at UX.
While the applications did what they were meant to do, it was not enjoyable using them.

And I didn't pay too much attention to that. Because hey it works! Moving the elements around, improving the layout was
just "a minor tweak". What's the big deal about that?

Suddenly (well after I got snowballed with loads of requests from the users), I realised that for the end user, it doesn't matter whether it's just a minor tweak, or there are loads of bugs.
For the end user, the result is the same: it doesn't really work. It **is** a bug, not a minor tweak
because it prevents from completing the user's tasks.

That was my moment of epiphany. It's easy to forget that not all users are living in front of the computer, for some of them, the computer is just a tool, an obstacle.

Since then, my software got much better. The users are happier. And I became happier when working because I see that my software makes their lives easier.
